\section{Introduction}


For \textit{Maze}, we accomplished an interactive WPF application that involves computer generated mazes. We are using a Binary Algorithm to create the mazes due to its ability to create infinite sized mazes very quickly. The maze will be seen in an isometric view where the viewer will only be able to see a portion and the screen will move with the player. 

Maze is intended for people who enjoy puzzle games. It offers a simple distraction to the constant boredom most humans suffer from.  We hope our audience will achieve a sense of fulfillment out of our game because they solved a maze or multiple mazes. 

\subsection{Background}
We want to our maze to be 'perfect' and  'orthogonal' \cite{Pullen}. A 'perfect' maze means that the maze lacks loops and closed circuits. So the maze does not have any unreachable areas. In addition, 'perfect' implies that there is exactly one path. There are multiple ways to do this. For example, one of the easiest ways to achieve a perfect orthogonal algorithm is to a Binary Tree algorithm.  Although the Binary Tree algorithm is simple and fast, there is one con it is very biased due how it  creates the maze. Each cell carves the next cell by randomly choosing a cell that is either two directions which causes the product to have passages that lead diagonally from upper left to lower right. We overlooked this downside because of the ease of implementation.

We wanted to do this project because of the implementation of an algorithm that we learned in CSCI 325. In addition, this application allows us to gain an understanding of how game applications work.


\subsection{Challenges}
There were many challenges to this project. With the CONVID-19 outbreak, we lost the ease of the communication which was the first step of our mighty downfall. There were multiple challenges: implementing a way to view the maze, player movement, and the settings menu. The biggest challenge implementing a way to view the maze, because the algorithm only returns whether the cell is linked. Although we never accomplished the player movement. The Settings menu's challenges were diverse because we had to understand how to pass on the settings values that the user selected to other pages.

\section{Scope}
Our project is done when we have a 'perfect' 'orthogonal' maze application with a top-down view. In addition, the user will be able to view a menu with buttons that'll allow them to make binary tree maze and format it to be viewed top-down. 
\subsection{Stretch Goals:}
We completed 1 out 4 of our stretch goals.  The timer is half-way implemented. It shows a timer but when the user pauses the maze it does not stop the timer. We did not complete the \textit{scored} stretch goal, because of the timer issue and the inability to gather points. We minimally completed the \textit{music} stretch goal. The music does not continuously play, but it does restart every time the user opens a new window. The \textit{secret buttons} implementation was not attempted.
\begin{itemize}
\item Timed: The user can see how long it took them to complete that maze.
\item Scored: The user can earn points by collecting items across the maze.
\item Music: The user can have music while completing the maze.
\item Secret Buttons: The user can access special items or areas when standing on secret button

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Requirements}
For our requirements, we met a portion of them. We were able to complete all of the nonfunctional requirements. The application uses the binary tree algorithm to create a maze within one second on worst case scenario \ref{item:NF2}. For the \textit{scalability} \ref{item:NF1}, there is a global maze variable that a power user can adjust when they want a bigger or smaller maze. The functional requirements that we met are \ref{itm:F1},\ref{itm:F2},\ref{itm:F3}, and\ref{itm:F4}. The functional requirements that we did not meet: \ref{itm:F5}, \ref{itm:F6}, and \ref{itm:F7}. 
\subsubsection{Functional}
\begin{enumerate}
\item User needs to be able to view the GUI\label{itm:F1} 
\item User needs to be able to interact with the GUI\label{itm:F2} 
\item User needs to view the maze\label{itm:F3} 
\item User needs to be able to interact with the maze\label{itm:F4} 
\item Application needs to be able to save 3 games\label{itm:F5} 
\item Application needs to be able to load any of the three saved games \label{itm:F6}
\item Application will record high scores \label{itm:F7}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional}
\begin{itemize}
\item Performance- Application will create mazes in a short amount of time\label{item:NF2} 
\item Scalability - Application will create mazes of different sizes\label{item:NF1}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use Cases}


We have seven use cases. \ref{UC:StartNewGame} is medium complexity because all this case required was transferring of the data values: size, settings choices. In addition, it needed to show a game screen after the \textit{New Game} button was clicked. \ref{UC:Customize} is medium complexity and $2_{nd}$ priority because it only requires an small understanding of how GUI works and how to transfer values from one page to the next. In addition, Customize does not impede any other use case, so this is why it has a low priority. \ref{UC:Save} is medium complexity and low priority because it's implementation only effects \ref{UC:Load} because Load calls upon the data that \ref{UC:Save} saved. \ref{UC:Scores} is low priority and medium difficulty because it does not affect any other use case. \ref{UC:Play} is high priority and very complex. Playing the game is the sole purpose of this project so its complexity and priority demonstrate this. \ref{UC:Credits} is listed as an easy task and low priority because it does not impede any other use case and its just an information window.

\section{Results}
The result of our project is sad. We barely accomplished half of the work. We were unable to meet the minimum requirements. In summary, we have a half implemented maze game
This section will start out a little vague, but it should grow as your project evolves.  With each deliverable you hand in, give me a final summary of where your project stands.  By the end, this should be a reflective section discussing how many of your original goals you managed to attain/how many desired use cases you implemented/how many extra features you added.

\subsection{Future Work}
Future work, we will delete all copies of the game, and forget this catastrophe ever existed. In addition, this partnership will never happen again.
